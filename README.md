This app main objective is to be a visual aid for people who play driving/racing games with their mouse as steering, in my personal experience, the only way you can tell how much your're turning is when youre on cockpiut view, this app allows you to use more cameras and make your experience more comfortable

* THE GAME YOU PLAY HAS TO BE ON WINDOWED MODE OR BORDERLESS WINDOW, OTHERWISE IT WONT SHOW ON TOP OF YOUR GAME"
